# Employee-management-system
This is Employee Management System project based on java (OOPS concept ).

Welcome to the Employee Payroll System project in Java! This repository contains a comprehensive example of building a terminal-based Employee Payroll System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Through this project, you'll learn how to design and implement abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and explore inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism in Java.

🔥 What You'll Learn 🔥

✅ Designing an Employee Payroll System using OOP principles.
✅ Creating abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and implementing inheritance.
✅ Understanding encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and method overriding.
✅ Implementing a terminal-based user interface for interaction.
✅ Calculating salaries for both Full-Time and Part-Time employees with abstract methods.
✅ Managing employee records, salary updates, and removal using a Payroll System.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Abstract Employee class serving as the foundation for different employee types. Concrete subclasses FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee with salary calculation. A user-friendly terminal interface for easy interaction and data management. Demonstrates core OOP concepts with practical coding examples. Complete source code and step-by-step guide for better understanding. 🚀 Ready to dive in and enhance your Java skills?
